# The_prophetic_app

The prophetic app is an iOS app designed to play a guessing game with the user. The user inputs a number of their choice hoping to guess the number the app will choose. As if it were a human holding fingers behind their back asking "How many fingers am I holding up?"
If the user can correctly guess the random number that the app generates the app will inform them of the correct response. If the user incorrectly guesses the app will also inform them.
